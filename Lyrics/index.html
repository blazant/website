            Ring, do you hear me callin'?
            Purps On The Beat
            Me no want no drama

            Do you hear me callin'?
            Do you hear me callin'?
            Me no want no drama
            Not a fighter, a lover
            Do you hear me callin'?
            Do you hear me callin'?
            Me no want no drama
            I just want you, my darling

            Break away and make a way to make it
            Love the way you looking when you naked
            Treat your heart just like a blunt of OG
            Roll it up, I kissed it and I smoke it
            
            Gots to be jokin'
            Where in the fuck did you think you were goin'?
            Folding and packing your clothes
            Like you ain't know I was gon' unfold it
            A wine glass full of your emotions
            Oh, Pinot Grigio, sipping, beautiful
            Heaven-soul woman
            
            Me don't know, let me know
            Let me in your heart
            Don't you dare forget me
            I'm your fan, your poster's on my walls
            Inside my head, yeah, yeah
            I'm your fan, your poster's on my walls
            Inside my head, yeah
            
            Do you hear me callin'?
            Do you hear me callin'?
            Me no want no drama
            Not a fighter, a lover
            Do you hear me callin'?
            Do you hear me callin'?
            Me no want no drama
            I just want you, my darling
            
            You drive me insane, no girl make me feel this way
            Wait girl, you got your ways, girl you are my getaway
            Wait, let me keep you safe
            In exchange, give me brain, brain
            You my main thing, turn around, bang bang
            
            Hit the beach in L.A. like you a beach ball
            Me and you in the Lambo' truck
            You start it up and skrrt off
            We park after dark at the park by the Mansion
            Take your skirt off
            Oh, me can't wait to get all up inside of it
            
            My heart is racing, every time I'm tasting it
            Wait until the drugs fade out
            Hate making love when I'm faded
            That's because I wanna feel it
            Girl, you give me the best feeling
            Yes, girl you the best, take away stress, love me to death
            Even when I'm a mess

            Do you hear me callin'?
            Do you hear me callin'?
            Me no want no drama
            Not a fighter, a lover
            Do you hear me callin'?
            Do you hear me callin'?
            Me no want no drama
            I just want you, my darling (darling)
            
            Ring, do you hear me callin'?
            Me no want no drama
            Ring, do you hear me callin'?
            Me no want no drama
